This isn't you're typical blog.

I'm not an undergrad at the University of Florida, and I do not study Computer Science. I'm not a machine learning or data scientist, and I don't spend my free time doing personal projects that interest me. I didn't just pick up the piano, and I didn't make a lot of progress in playing piano in the past few months! I don't currently research deep learning models for audio classification and imitation, and I've never worked as software engineering intern early in my undergrad. 


This is not a picture of me.
